(hex) At dawn, a ancient bell tolled... ' Silence  falls  ' (low, 2) . 
But then, IT (low, 1) BEGINS (up, 2) , suddenly...!?  Was anyone ready?!

1E (hex) pilgrims arrived, then 1010 (bin) more; by dusk, FF (hex) had vanished. 
A honest rumor spread: ' they left  quickly '!?  Or was it ' they stayed  quietly '?!

'  Quote-tightening  #1  ' ,works; ' Quote-tightening #2 '!? works too; '  inner  spaces  '... gone.
ok: 'edge'world, 'edge',world, 'edge'!?fine, 'edge'...fine, 'edge'?!, fine.

A hour passed; a unusual omen; a eagle cried; a honest scribe wrote; 
A Honest figure appeared; A unusual path opened; a owl watched; a apple fell.

This is the test (cap, 3) for mixed (up, 2) ranges (low, 0) . 
ready , set ; go (up, 3) ! and then calm (cap, 2) returns . 
before (cap) midnight, secrets stir; IT WAS THE (low, 3) end, or the beginning (up, 0) ?

Bad-but-legal tags appear: (up, 0) should do nothing, (low, 000) nothing, (cap, 1) once,
while malformed-looking words in parens (lower, 2) must remain as-is in output.

Start-of-line tag should be ignored: 
(hex) preparation continues; (bin) calculations continue; (cap) echoes; (low, 5) …

Spaces normalize but line breaks stay:

Line A, spaced   oddly   , indeed  ; yes  ! 
Line B...  continues ,with vigor !?
Line C asks    ?!

'  tighten left & right  '  and  'right-only   '  and  '   left-only'  and  '  exact  ' .
'pair one' 'pair two' 'pair three', all good.

Numbers near punctuation: 2A (hex) ,  111 (bin) !  3E (hex) ?  100000 (bin) ; done.

Articles must cross quotes:
a 'eagle' flew; A 'Honest' trader arrived; a 'apple' rolled; A 'hour' passed; 
meanwhile, 'owl' a opportunity? and 'hour' a honest tale.

Case ranges must skip punctuation when counting:
turn it up , now ; go (cap, 4) quickly beyond.
expect: turn it Up, Now; Go Quickly beyond.

Quotes around punctuation groups:
' hush '!? ' wait '?! ' stop '... ' now '!!! proceed.

Edge adjacency at boundaries:
Beginning:'start'and then; end here with 'finish'anddone.

Nested-ish (but still linear) quotes:
He said, 'I think 'this' works', and left.
Then: ' outer ' and ' inner ', followed by ' final '.

Big-but-valid numbers:
FFFFFFFF (hex) arrived; 00000000 (bin) left; 7F (hex) lingered; 1 (bin) remained.

Invalid-number shapes must survive unchanged:
0x10 (hex) stays; 2b (bin) stays; G1 (hex) stays; 102 (bin) stays.

Mixed punctuation clusters must hug and leave one space after:
Look here,...!? see that?!... now!?
Then—'done'!? next.

Across multiple lines, preserve layout:

Alpha, beta, gamma...
Delta,epsilon ,zeta !
Eta   ?!

Final gauntlet of tags + punctuation + quotes:
' coded ' (cap, 2) example here, 'shout' (up) ,please; soft 'WHISPER' (low) ,thanks;
' equalize ' (low, 3) Words NEXT, then ' proper ' (cap) end.

Ensure no trailing space at EOF.
