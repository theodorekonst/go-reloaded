(hex) Before anything begins...  there was '  chaos  '  (low, 9999999).  
"Wait"—no, 'Wait'—actually (bin)  111111 (cap, 2) ... or was it (hex)  G1?  

a hourglass fell... a honest man watched it (low,0) ;  and a unusual owl whispered, softly.  
A honest hero heard 'a hour  of hope'... or maybe '  an hour  of horror  '?  

'He said ''I am the chosen (up, 2) one'', then vanished!' she whispered, 'and so it begins...'  
'She replied  : "  no (low, x) ... you’re wrong " ,and  left  .'  
Notice?  There are nested single + double quotes + malformed tags in one sentence.  

' this   is  ...  '   (cap)  pure  madness  (up, 0)  !!!  
and look closely — three exclamation marks (should stay tight!!!).  

Binary trickery:  1010 (bin), 00000000 (bin), and 2b (bin) — wait, 2b isn’t valid binary (should remain).  
Hex chaos:  FF (hex), 0x10 (hex), 10 (hex), G1 (hex), 1E (hex) .  

Mix quotes and punctuation:  ' hello '!? ... ' goodbye '?!, both  should remain tight.  
' punctuation ' (low, 2) and 'tags'  (cap, 1)  should  reorder nicely.  

Spaces from hell: multiple     spaces     ,   and      tabs	,    plus newlines:

A unusual event
	with strange indentation
and  trailing spaces   	   

...should normalize but preserve the line structure.

Now we get meta: '(up, 2)' should NOT transform inside quotes — it's just text.
Same for '(hex)' inside quotes: "'(hex)' is literally said" — don’t convert.

Articles and capitalization collide: a Honest man, A honest day, a Owl, A unusual hour, A Hourglass.
Also: 'a Honest trader' and 'A unusual apple' inside quotes.  

Crazy punctuation groups:  ...!?!!!??...?! Should all stay glued to previous word, with one space after.  
Also edge punctuation before quotes: ,.'!?; should attach correctly like this: word,.'!?; 'quote'.  

Invalid combinations: (cap, -3) (low, 0x2) (up, y) (down, 2) — none should crash anything.
Partial tags: (up (low), )cap), (,), ((up,3)), (low, 1 1).  

Check extreme numbers: FFFFFFFF (hex) should be converted safely to decimal if possible; 
otherwise, just ignore gracefully.  
Same for 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 (bin).  

Quotes hugging newlines:
' first line '
'second line'
'single'line
' end '!

a honest ' apple ', a unusual ' hour ', a owl, A hour — all should be fixed correctly.

Line endings: CRLF Windows style\r\n should be handled too.
And Unicode edge: café (cap), naïve (low), résumé (up, 2) — should not corrupt multibyte chars.

End of everything... ' the final   test   ' (cap, 4)  ...?!  maybe   'or  not'!?!!!
Ensure no extra space before EOF.
