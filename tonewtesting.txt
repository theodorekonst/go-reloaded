The ancient wizard found an incredible spell in a hidden archive. 
He whispered softly, then shouted THE POWER WORDS, and paused...!? Was it working?

Simply add 42 and 13, then 62, and finally 7. The total should amaze an honest observer.

Bad tags should not explode: up, x low, -3 cap, +2 and weird ones like or (lower, 2) should be ignored gracefully. 
Zero range should do nothing: hello world; stay the same please.

Quotes must tighten: 'this is it!' and 'spaced words' but unmatched quotes should remain: 'unfinished line here
Nested-ish pairs should be okay:' outer start 'and' inner here ', then back to normal.

Invalid numbers must not convert: 0x1E should remain 0x1E; and 102 should remain 102. 
Valid numbers should convert nearby: 170, 10, 255, 32.

Case ranges skip punctuation: READY, SET; GO! should become READY, SET; GO! punctuation hugged and one space after.
Title casing: become A Hero of legend → expect become a Hero Of legend; 
but then an Eagle arrives; also An honest mistake becomes an honest mistake.

Articles before vowels or h: an unusual aura; a hourglass; an Honest trader; an ENCHANTED blade; an owl watched; an apple fell.
Keep case on A→An: An unusual event, An hour wasted, An honest tale.

Multiple spaces around punctuation should normalize: 
It was time, truly, indeed; yes! And then... we left?!

Line breaks must stay:
First line, with a pause...
Second line continues, with more words!
Third line asks a question?!

Edge spacing with tags: 
It was the END, or was it the BEGINNING? We Shall See!
Also Check across Punctuation: Winter, Fall; Spring arrives now.

Quotes around spans with punctuation inside should tighten only at the edges:' an owl hooted, softly; then silence 'and then we move on.' I must succeed 'he muttered;' do not fail 'he warned.

Article after quotes and spaces:' owl 'an opportunity to learn; but' hour ' an honest error to fix.

Mixed groups: wait... really!? or maybe?! who knows...

Ensure no trailing space at EOF after punctuation.
