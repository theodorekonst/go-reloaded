At dawn, an ancient bell tolled... ' silence falls'. 
But then, IT BEGINS, suddenly...!? Was anyone ready?!

30 pilgrims arrived, then 10 more; by dusk, 255 had vanished. 
An honest rumor spread: ' they left quickly'!? Or was it ' they stayed quietly'?!

' Quote-tightening #1', works; ' Quote-tightening #2'!? works too; ' inner spaces'... gone.
ok: ' edge' world, ' edge', world, ' edge'!? fine, ' edge'... fine, ' edge'?!, fine.

An hour passed; an unusual omen; an eagle cried; an honest scribe wrote; 
An Honest figure appeared; An unusual path opened; an owl watched; an apple fell.

This Is The Test FOR MIXED ranges. 
READY, SET; GO! and Then Calm returns. 
Before midnight, secrets stir; it was the end, or the beginning?

Bad-but-legal tags appear: should do nothing, Nothing, once,
while malformed-looking words in parens must remain as-is in output.

Start-of-line tag should be ignored: 
 preparation continues; calculations continue; echoes; …

Spaces normalize but line breaks stay:

Line A, spaced oddly, indeed; yes! 
Line B... continues, with vigor!?
Line C asks?!

' tighten left & right' and ' right-only' and ' left-only' and ' exact'.
' pair one' ' pair two' ' pair three', all good.

Numbers near punctuation: 42, 7! 62? 32; done.

Articles must cross quotes:
an ' eagle' flew; An ' Honest' trader arrived; an ' apple' rolled; An ' hour' passed; 
meanwhile, ' owl' an opportunity? and ' hour' an honest tale.

Case ranges must skip punctuation when counting:
turn It Up, Now; Go quickly beyond.
expect: turn it Up, Now; Go Quickly beyond.

Quotes around punctuation groups:
' hush'!? ' wait'?! ' stop'... ' now'!!! proceed.

Edge adjacency at boundaries:
Beginning: ' start' and then; end here with ' finish' anddone.

Nested-ish quotes:
He said, ' I think' this' works', and left.
Then: ' outer' and ' inner', followed by ' final'.

Big-but-valid numbers:
4294967295 arrived; 0 left; 127 lingered; 1 remained.

Invalid-number shapes must survive unchanged:
0x10 stays; 2b stays; G1 stays; 102 stays.

Mixed punctuation clusters must hug and leave one space after:
Look here,...!? see that?!... now!?
Then—' done'!? next.

Across multiple lines, preserve layout:

Alpha, beta, gamma...
Delta, epsilon, zeta!
Eta?!

Final gauntlet of tags + punctuation + Quotes:
' Coded' example here, ' SHOUT', please; soft ' whisper', thanks;
' equalize' Words NEXT, then ' Proper' end.

Ensure no trailing space at EOF.
